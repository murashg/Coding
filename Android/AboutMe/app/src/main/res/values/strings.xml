    <string name="bio">Hi I\'m Greg,\n I\'m an outgoing charismatic young man with a passion for Learning, Social Networking, and Technology. Earned my BS and Minor in under 4 years. Took a job with Expeditors for the work experience and am now pursuing certifications and my next venture. I\'m fascinated by the advancements in Computer Technologies, whether it be in Machine Learning, Graphics or AR/VR I want to be part of the next generation of software developers pushing the forefront of what is possible to do with a computer. When I\'m not behind a screen you could find me at the local Climbing gym, exploring the PNW on my \'09 KLR 650, or playing Trumpet with my band, Bob Fossil. </string>
